# Fraud-Detection-ML-Project


Dataset: -
The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and
the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles) on
big data mining and fraud detection.
This dataset contains the anonymized transactions from all the European credit cards
between 01.03.2015 and 31.05.2015. The classification task is to predict the class of the
transactions (genuine or fraudulent).
It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation.
Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, data is not provided in the original features and
more background information about the data is hidden.
